# File Organizer

I made this files organizer to make my life easier when I'm dealing with a bunch of messy files.

## Sorter

So, with the `sorter`, I can:

- Organize my files into neat directories based on what I tell it.
- See all the directories in the place I want to move my files to.
- Read PDF files and show me the pages I want.
- Rename my files or folders.
- Delete files or folders.
- Move files between different folders.
- Get a list of all the commands I can use.

#### How to Use sorter:
Just start it up with `python sorter.py`. The program begins by asking you about your files' source and the target directory. It then shows a list of all the directories in the target directory and loops through files that are not directories one by one, asking you what you want to do with each of them.
You can enter 'h' to get the commands' list: 
```
--- Enter your command: h
> Enter a number to access the directory
> Enter (r) to read the file
> Enter (.) to save the file here
> Enter (..) to navigate to the parent directory
> Enter (+) to create a directory
> Enter (d) to delete the file
> Enter (D) to delete a directory
> Enter (n) to show the name of the file
> Enter (re) to rename the file
> Enter (dirs) to display directories
> Enter (redir) to rename a directory
> Enter (mv) to move a directory
> Enter (-) to move to the next file
> Enter (q) to exit
```
And the folders are displayed like this: 
```
(1)> Articles
(2)> Biology
(3)> Computer Science
(4)> Languages
(5)> Mathematics
(6)> Pictures
(7)> Physics
```

## Manager

Manager is for grouping a bunch of files in 1 directory by common keywords and moving them all to another directory. Like taking all the trailing 'SCREENSHOTS*.jpg' and putting them back to the folder where they belong.

#### How to Use manager:

- Tell it where your messy files are.
- Give it a spot to create the new folder.
- Think of a cool name for the new folder.
- Tell it how many keywords you would enter.
- Start typing the keywords one by one as it asks.
